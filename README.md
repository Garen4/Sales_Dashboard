I'm thrilled to present my recent project where I utilized Looker to create an interactive sales dashboard.

🔍 Project Overview: I developed a comprehensive sales dashboard to provide an in-depth analysis of sales data across various regions, categories, and segments.
Insights 🔻 :
- Total number of orders
- Total profit 
- Total quantities 

Map 🔻 : 
- The locations with the best sales performance by country.
Percentage of sales :
- Region
- Category
- Segment

📈 Impact: The dashboard has enabled a more efficient analysis of sales data, leading to better-informed decisions and strategic planning. Key insights include:
- Highest sales in the Technology category.
- Consumer segment showing the largest number of sales.
- Significant sales activity concentrated in the West region.
